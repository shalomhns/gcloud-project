# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
# Objectives:
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
   
    -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
    -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
    -Connect between the two instances.

# Steps:
1: Create a virtual machine using the GCP Command LIne:

1a: -Create an Instance page, for Name, type my-vm-1
    -For Region and Zone, select the region and zone assigned by Qwiklabs.
    -For Machine type, accept the default.
    -For Boot disk, if the Image shown is not Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch), click Change and select Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).
    -Leave the defaults for Identity and API access unmodified.
    -For Firewall, click Allow HTTP traffic.
    -Leave all other defaults unmodified.

        gcloud compute instances Create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" --tags http

        gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=Allow --destination=INGRESS --rules=http=80 --target-tags=http


2a:  Creating a second virtual machine using the gcloud command line:
     You need to choose a zone other than the one assign  to you in the prevous vm creation. Hence you need to meke use of the grep tools to output list of zones to choose from the region.
     Therefore To display a list of all the zones in the region to which Qwiklabs assigned you followed by the region that Qwiklabs or your instructor assigned you to:
 
        gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1

2b: Choose a zone from that list other than the zone to which Qwiklabs assigned you. For example, if Qwiklabs assigned you to region us-central1 and zone us-central1-a you might choose zone us-central1-b

2c: To set your default zone to the one you just chose, enter this partial command gcloud config set compute/zone followed by the zone you chose
    the completed command looks like this:

        gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

2d: To create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in that zone, execute this command:

        gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"

    # Note: Its take like two minute to be available.


3: Connect between VM instances

3a: Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:
    -connect to my-vm-2:
     
     gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

3b: Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network

        ping -c 4 my-vm-1

    #Notice that the output of the ping command reveals that the complete 
    hostname of my-vm-1 is my-vm-1.c.PROJECT_ID.internal, where PROJECT_ID 
    is the name of your Google Cloud Platform project. GCP automatically 
    supplies Domain Name Service (DNS) resolution for the internal IP 
    addresses of VM instances.

3c:Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:

        ssh my-vm-1

3d: At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server

        sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

3e: Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server


        sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

3d:Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, 
   and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

        Hi from Adeyemi O Samson

3e: Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the 
    nano text editor

3f: Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, 
    execute this command


        curl http://localhost/

    #Response : The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your 
    line of custom text.

3g: To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

        exit

    #Note: You will return to the command prompt on my-vm-2

3h: To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, 
    execute this command:

    curl http://my-vm-1/

    #Response: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including 
    your line of custom text

3i: How to get the external IP of my-vm-1 instance from command line:

    gcloud compute instance list

3j: copy and paste the output external IP address of my-vm-1 into a new browser tab and press enter.


    #Response: You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.

    #Note: If you forgot to click Allow HTTP traffic when you created the my-vm-1 VM instance, your 
     attempt to reach your web server's home page will fail. You can add a firewall rule to allow 
     inbound traffic to your instances, although this topic is out of scope for this course.
