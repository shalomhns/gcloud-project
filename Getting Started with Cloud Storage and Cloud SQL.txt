#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL

#Objective: In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

    -Create a Cloud Storage bucket and place an image into it.
    -Create a Cloud SQL instance and configure it.
    -Connect to the Cloud SQL instance from a web server.
    -Use the image in the Cloud Storage bucket on a web page.

#Steps:
: Create a virtual machine using the GCP Command LIne:

1a: -Create an Instance page, for Name, type my-vm-1
    -For Region and Zone, select the region and zone assigned by Qwiklabs.
    -For Machine type, accept the default.
    -For Boot disk, if the Image shown is not Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch), click Change and select Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch).
    -Leave the defaults for Identity and API access unmodified.
    -For Firewall, click Allow HTTP traffic.
    -Leave all other defaults unmodified.

        gcloud compute instances Create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" --tags http

        gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=Allow --destination=INGRESS --rules=http=80 --target-tags=http

# Making cloud stotage bucket using cloud shell:

#For convenience, enter your chosen location into an environment variable called LOCATION

        export LOCATION=US

#Note that the label of our cloud storage bucket must be globally unique that is why the easiest way to 
 name it is to name the bucket with our gcp project ID. So in the cloud shell enviromment variable 
 DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID always contain our project ID


        gsutil mb -l $LOCATION gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID


# Then we will copy a graphical image from another storage bucket this one is called cloud training


        gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gcpfci/my-excellent-blog.png my-excellent-blog.png

#Now we use the gsutil Command again to uplaod it to our cloud storage bucket

        gsutil cp my-excellent-blog.png gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png

# We modify the Access Control List of the object we just created so that it is readable by everyone


        gsutil acl ch -u allUsers:R gs://$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/my-excellent-blog.png

#Create the Cloud SQL instance
